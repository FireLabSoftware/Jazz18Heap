# Jazz18Heap
Jazz18Heap is designed to search large numbers of short read datasets ("target files"-- fasta or fastq with or without gz) for reads that match a defined query.  Output can either be a list of files that have matches to the query or a set of reads derived from target files where at least one k-mer matches that query.
